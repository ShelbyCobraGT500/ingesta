abstract = {Codon usage and tRNA abundance are critical parameters for gene synthesis. However, the forces determining codon usage bias within genomes and between organisms, as well as the functional roles of biased codon compositions, remain poorly understood. Similarly, the composition and dynamics of mature tRNA populations in cells in terms of isoacceptor abundances, and the prevalence and function of base modifications are not well understood. As we begin to decipher some of the rules that govern codon usage and tRNA abundances, it is becoming clear that these parameters are a way to not only increase gene expression, but also regulate the speed of ribosomal translation, the efficiency of protein folding, and the coordinated expression of functionally related gene families. Here, we discuss the importance of codon-anticodon interactions in translation regulation and highlight the contribution of non-random codon distributions and post-transcriptional base modifications to this regulation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The goal of this group project has been to coordinate and bring up-to-date information on all genes of Escherichia coli K-12. Annotation of the genome of an organism entails identification of genes, the boundaries of genes in terms of precise start and end sites, and description of the gene products. Known and predicted functions were assigned to each gene product on the basis of experimental evidence or sequence analysis. Since both kinds of evidence are constantly expanding, no annotation is complete at any moment in time. This is a snapshot analysis based on the most recent genome sequences of two E.coli K-12 bacteria. An accurate and up-to-date description of E.coli K-12 genes is of particular importance to the scientific community because experimentally determined properties of its gene products provide fundamental information for annotation of innumerable genes of other organisms. Availability of the complete genome sequence of two K-12 strains allows comparison of their genotypes and mutant status of alleles.},

abstract = {RNA-RNA interactions are fast emerging as a major functional component in many newly discovered non-coding RNAs. Basepairing is believed to be a major contributor to the stability of these intermolecular interactions, much like intramolecular basepairs formed in RNA secondary structure. As such, using algorithms similar to those for predicting RNA secondary structure, computational methods have been recently developed for the prediction of RNA-RNA interactions.We provide the first comprehensive comparison comprising 14 methods that predict general intermolecular basepairs. To evaluate these, we compile an extensive data set of 54 experimentally confirmed fungal snoRNA-rRNA interactions and 102 bacterial sRNA-mRNA interactions. We test the performance accuracy of all methods, evaluating the effects of tool settings, sequence length, and multiple sequence alignment usage and quality.Our results show that-unlike for RNA secondary structure prediction-the overall best performing tools are non-comparative energy-based tools utilizing accessibility information that predict short interactions on this data set. Furthermore, we find that maintaining high accuracy across biologically different data sets and increasing input lengths remains a huge challenge, causing implications for de novo transcriptome-wide searches. Finally, we make our interaction data set publicly available for future development and benchmarking efforts.},

abstract = {In pathogenic bacteria, a large number of sRNAs coordinate adaptation to stress and expression of virulence genes. To better understand the turnover of regulatory sRNAs in the model pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium, we have constructed mutants for several ribonucleases (RNase E, RNase G, RNase III, PNPase) and Poly(A) Polymerase I. The expression profiles of four sRNAs conserved among many enterobacteria, CsrB, CsrC, MicA and SraL, were analysed and the processing and stability of these sRNAs was studied in the constructed strains. The degradosome was a common feature involved in the turnover of these four sRNAs. PAPI-mediated polyadenylation was the major factor governing SraL degradation. RNase III was revealed to strongly affect MicA decay. PNPase was shown to be important in the decay of these four sRNAs. The stability of CsrB and CsrC seemed to be independent of the RNA chaperone, Hfq, whereas the decay of SraL and MicA was Hfq-dependent. Taken together, the results of this study provide initial insight into the mechanisms of sRNA decay in Salmonella, and indicate specific contributions of the RNA decay machinery components to the turnover of individual sRNAs.},

abstract = {Gene regulation was long thought to be controlled almost entirely by proteins that bind to DNA and RNA. Over the last years, it has become clear that small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are important in almost every facet of gene regulation. Understanding how they are matured and degraded has therefore become of maximum importance, in order to know how to "regulate the regulators." Ribonucleases perform a key role in the biogenesis and processing of sRNAs, as well as in controlling their cellular levels through regulation of their turnover. Accordingly, RNases can have a major impact on sRNAs regulatory pathways. In this review, we present an overview of what is presently known about the main RNases, as well as other factors involved in sRNA processing and turnover, in essence contributing to the assembly of the increasing number of pieces in the puzzling global mechanism of sRNA regulation. Although the primary focus will be on bacterial sRNAs, parallels will be made with the siRNAs and miRNAs in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {sRNAs are small, non-coding RNA species that control numerous cellular processes. Although it is widely accepted that sRNAs are encoded by most if not all bacteria, genome-wide annotations for sRNA-encoding genes have been conducted in only a few of the nearly 300 bacterial species sequenced to date. To facilitate the efficient annotation of bacterial genomes for sRNA-encoding genes, we developed a program, sRNAPredict2, that identifies putative sRNAs by searching for co-localization of genetic features commonly associated with sRNA-encoding genes. Using sRNAPredict2, we conducted genome-wide annotations for putative sRNA-encoding genes in the intergenic regions of 11 diverse pathogens. In total, 2759 previously unannotated candidate sRNA loci were predicted. There was considerable range in the number of sRNAs predicted in the different pathogens analyzed, raising the possibility that there are species-specific differences in the reliance on sRNA-mediated regulation. Of 34 previously unannotated sRNAs predicted in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 31 were experimentally tested and 17 were found to encode sRNA transcripts. Our findings suggest that numerous genes have been missed in the current annotations of bacterial genomes and that, by using improved bioinformatic approaches and tools, much remains to be discovered in 'intergenic' sequences.},

abstract = {The rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SS101 inhibits growth of oomycete and fungal pathogens, and induces resistance in plants against pathogens and insects. To unravel regulatory pathways of secondary metabolite production in SS101, we conducted a genome-wide search for sRNAs and performed transcriptomic analyses to identify genes associated with the Rsm (repressor of secondary metabolites) regulon. In silico analysis led to the identification of 16 putative sRNAs in the SS101 genome. In frame deletion of the sRNAs rsmY and rsmZ showed that the Rsm system regulates the biosynthesis of the lipopeptide massetolide A and involves the two repressor proteins RsmA and RsmE, with the LuxR-type transcriptional regulator MassAR as their most likely target. Transcriptome analyses of the rsmYZ mutant further revealed that genes associated with iron acquisition, motility and chemotaxis were significantly upregulated, whereas genes of the type VI secretion system were downregulated. Comparative transcriptomic analyses showed that most, but not all, of the genes controlled by RsmY/RsmZ are also controlled by the GacS/GacA two-component system. We conclude that the Rsm regulon of P. fluorescens SS101 plays a critical role in the regulation of lipopeptide biosynthesis and controls the expression of other genes involved in motility, competition and survival in the plant rhizosphere.},

Assuming that most RNAs require proteins to exert their activities, we purified and identified sRNA-binding factors via affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. We consistently obtained RNA polymerase betasubunit, host factor Hfq and ribosomal protein S1 as sRNA-binding proteins in addition to several other factors. Most importantly, we observed that RNA polymerase not only binds several sRNAs but also reacts with them, both cleaving and extending the RNAs at their 3 ends. The fact that the RNA polymerase reacts with sRNAs maps their interaction site to the active centre cleft of the enzyme and shows that it takes RNAs as template to perform RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. We further performed genomic SELEX to isolate RNA polymerase-binding RNAs and obtained a large number of E. coli sequences binding with high affinity to this enzyme. In vivo binding of some of the RNAs to the RNA polymerase was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation in cell extracts prepared from different growth conditions. Our observations show that RNA polymerase is able to bind and react with many different RNAs and we suggest that RNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation more frequently than anticipated.},

DsrA has opposite effects on these transcriptional regulators. H-NS levels decrease, whereas RpoS (final sigma(s)) levels increase. Here we show that DsrA enhances hns mRNA turnover yet stabilizes rpoS mRNA, either directly or via effects on translation. Computational and RNA footprinting approaches led to a refined structure for DsrA, and a model in which DsrA interacts with the hns mRNA start and stop codon regions to form a coaxial stack. Analogous bipartite interactions exist in eukaryotes, albeit with different regulatory consequences. In contrast, DsrA base pairs in discrete fashion with the rpoS RNA translational operator. Thus, different structural configurations for DsrA lead to opposite regulatory consequences for target RNAs.},

abstract = {The interactions of numerous regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) with target mRNAs have been characterized, but how sRNAs can regulate multiple, structurally unrelated mRNAs is less understood. Here we show that Salmonella GcvB sRNA directly acts on seven target mRNAs that commonly encode periplasmic substrate-binding proteins of ABC uptake systems for amino acids and peptides. Alignment of GcvB homologs of distantly related bacteria revealed a conserved G/U-rich element that is strictly required for GcvB target recognition. Analysis of target gene fusion regulation in vivo, and in vitro structure probing and translation assays showed that GcvB represses its target mRNAs by binding to extended C/A-rich regions, which may also serve as translational enhancer elements. In some cases (oppA, dppA), GcvB repression can be explained by masking the ribosome-binding site (RBS) to prevent 30S subunit binding. However, GcvB can also effectively repress translation by binding to target mRNAs at upstream sites, outside the RBS. Specifically, GcvB represses gltI mRNA translation at the C/A-rich target site located at positions -57 to -45 relative to the start codon. Taken together, our study suggests highly conserved regions in sRNAs and mRNA regions distant from Shine-Dalgarno sequences as important elements for the identification of sRNA targets.},

We analysed in vitro and in vivo the role of Hfq in the interaction between the small RNA RyhB and its sodB (iron superoxide dismutase) mRNA target. Hfq bound strongly to sodB mRNA and altered the structure of the mRNA, partially opening a loop. This gives access to a sequence complementary to RyhB and encompassing the translation initiation codon. RyhB binding blocked the translation initiation codon of sodB and triggered the degradation of both RyhB and sodB mRNA. Thus, Hfq is a critical chaperone in vivo and in vitro, changing the folding of the target mRNA to make it subject to the small RNA regulator.},

However, many recently identified sRNAs lack obvious SD and AUG complementarity, indicating that sRNA-mediated translational control could also take place at other mRNA sites. We report that Salmonella RybB sRNA represses ompN mRNA translation by pairing with the 5 coding region. Results of systematic antisense interference with 30S binding to ompN and unrelated mRNAs suggest that sRNAs can act as translational repressors by sequestering sequences within the mRNA down to the fifth codon, even without SD and AUG start codon pairing. This "five codon window" for translational control in the 5 coding region of mRNA not only has implications for sRNA target predictions but might also apply to cis-regulatory systems such as RNA thermosensors and riboswitches. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

All expression of beta-galactosidase from the dsrB::lacZ fusion is also dependent on the stationary phase sigma factor, RpoS. DsrA RNA was found to regulate dsrB::lacZ indirectly, by modulating RpoS synthesis. Levels of RpoS protein are substantially lower in a dsrA mutant, both in stationary and exponential phase cells. Mutations in dsrA decrease the expression of an RpoS::LacZ translational fusion, but not a transcriptional fusion, suggesting that DsrA is acting after transcription initiation. While RpoS expression is very low in exponential phase at temperatures of 30 degrees C and above, at 20 degrees C there is substantial synthesis of RpoS during exponential growth, all dependent on DsrA RNA. dsrA expression is also increased at low temperatures.

The RyhB 90-nt RNA down-regulates a set of iron-storage and iron-using proteins when iron is limiting; it is itself negatively regulated by the ferric uptake repressor protein, Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). RyhB RNA levels are inversely correlated with mRNA levels for the sdhCDAB operon, encoding succinate dehydrogenase, as well as five other genes previously shown to be positively regulated by Fur by an unknown mechanism. These include two other genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, acnA and fumA, two ferritin genes, ftnA and bfr, and a gene for superoxide dismutase, sodB. Fur positive regulation of all these genes is fully reversed in an ryhB mutant. Our results explain the previously observed inability of fur mutants to grow on succinate. RyhB requires the RNA-binding protein, Hfq, for activity. Sequences within RyhB are complementary to regions within each of the target genes, suggesting that RyhB acts as an antisense RNA. In sdhCDAB, the complementary region is at the end of the first gene of the sdhCDAB operon; full-length sdhCDAB message disappears and a truncated message, equivalent in size to the region upstream of the complementarity, is detected when RyhB is expressed. RyhB provides a mechanism for the cell to down-regulate iron-storage proteins and nonessential iron-containing proteins when iron is limiting, thus modulating intracellular iron usage to supplement mechanisms for iron uptake directly regulated by Fur.},

abstract = {The bacterial Hfq protein modulates the stability or the translation of mRNAs and has recently been shown to interact with small regulatory RNAs in E. coli. Here we show that Hfq belongs to the large family of Sm and Sm-like proteins: it contains a conserved sequence motif, known as the Sm1 motif, forms a doughnut-shaped structure, and has RNA binding specificity very similar to the Sm proteins. Moreover, we provide evidence that Hfq strongly cooperates in intermolecular base pairing between the antisense regulator Spot 42 RNA and its target RNA. We speculate that Sm proteins in general cooperate in bimolecular RNA-RNA interaction and that protein-mediated complex formation permits small RNAs to interact with a broad range of target RNAs.},

abstract = {Post-transcriptional repression of porin synthesis has emerged as a major function of Hfq-dependent, small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Many enterobacteria express OmpX-like porins, a family of outer membrane proteins whose physiological roles and structural properties have been studied intensively. While regulatory sRNAs have been identified for most major and many minor porins of Salmonella and Escherichia coli, a post-transcriptional regulator of OmpX levels has never been found. Here, we have taken a 'reverse target search' approach by systematic inactivation of Salmonella sRNA genes, and screening 35 sRNA deletion strains for effects on OmpX synthesis. We have identified the Hfq-dependent CyaR (formerly RyeE) sRNA as an ompX repressor. Global transcriptomic profiling following induction of CyaR expression suggests that ompX mRNA is the primary target of this sRNA under standard growth conditions. The results of phylogenetic and mutational analyses suggest that a conserved RNA hairpin of CyaR, featuring a C-rich apical loop, acts to sequester the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of ompX mRNA and to inhibit translational initiation. We have also discovered that cyaR expression is tightly controlled by the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP. This represents a new link between porin repression and nutrient availability that is likely to be widely conserved among enterobacteria.},

These sRNAs act by base pairing with target mRNAs with which they share limited or extended complementarity, or by modulating protein activity, in some cases by mimicking other nucleic acids. Mechanistic insights into how sRNAs bind mRNAs and proteins, how they compete with each other, and how they interface with ribonucleases are active areas of discovery. Current work also has begun to illuminate how sRNAs modulate expression of distinct regulons and key transcription factors, thus integrating sRNA activity into extensive regulatory networks. In addition, the application of RNA deep sequencing has led to reports of hundreds of additional sRNA candidates in a wide swath of bacterial species.

abstract = {We developed a bacterial genetic system based on translation of the his operon leader peptide gene to determine the relative speed at which the ribosome reads single or multiple codons in vivo. Low frequency effects of so-called "silent" codon changes and codon neighbor (context) effects could be measured using this assay. An advantage of this system is that translation speed is unaffected by the primary sequence of the His leader peptide. We show that the apparent speed at which ribosomes translate synonymous codons can vary substantially even for synonymous codons read by the same tRNA species. Assaying translation through codon pairs for the 5'- and 3'- side positioning of the 64 codons relative to a specific codon revealed that the codon-pair orientation significantly affected in vivo translation speed. Codon pairs with rare arginine codons and successive proline codons were among the slowest codon pairs translated in vivo. This system allowed us to determine the effects of different factors on in vivo translation speed including Shine-Dalgarno sequence, rate of dipeptide bond formation, codon context, and charged tRNA levels.},

It is one of the most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes. It is shown that tRNA gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size and tRNA genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under the proposed model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ISA virus (ISAV) is an Orthomyxovirus whose genome encodes for at least 10 proteins. Low protein identity and lack of genetic tools have hampered the study of the molecular mechanism behind its virulence. It has been shown that viral codon usage controls several processes such as translational efficiency, folding, tuning of protein expression, antigenicity and virulence. Despite this, the possible role that adaptation to host codon usage plays in virulence and viral evolution has not been studied in ISAV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Intergenomic adaptation between viral and host genomes was calculated using the codon adaptation index score with EMBOSS software and the Kazusa database. Classification of host genes according to GeneOnthology was performed using Blast2go. A non parametric test was applied to determine the presence of significant correlations among CAI, mortality and time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using the codon adaptation index (CAI) score, we found that the encoding genes for nucleoprotein, matrix protein M1 and antagonist of Interferon I signaling (NS1) are the ISAV genes that are more adapted to host codon usage, in agreement with their requirement for production of viral particles and inactivation of antiviral responses. Comparison to host genes showed that ISAV shares CAI values with less than 0.45{\%} of Salmo salar genes. GeneOntology classification of host genes showed that ISAV genes share CAI values with genes from less than 3{\%} of the host biological process, far from the 14{\%} shown by Influenza A viruses and closer to the 5{\%} shown by Influenza B and C. As well, we identified a positive correlation (p{\textless}0.05) between CAI values of a virus and the duration of the outbreak disease in given salmon farms, as well as a weak relationship between codon adaptation values of PB1 and the mortality rates of a set of ISA viruses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that ISAV is the least adapted viral Salmo salar pathogen and Orthomyxovirus family member less adapted to host codon usage, avoiding the general behavior of host genes. This is probably due to its recent emergence among farmed Salmon populations.},

Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ∼30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ∼50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow " ramp" at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the recent discovery of the protein ProQ as a common binding partner that stabilizes a distinct large class of structured sRNAs suggests that additional RNA regulons exist in these organisms. The cellular functions and molecular mechanisms of these new ProQ-dependent sRNAs are largely unknown. Here, we report in Salmonella Typhimurium the mode-of-action of RaiZ, a ProQ-dependent sRNA that is made from the 3' end of the mRNA encoding ribosome-inactivating protein RaiA. We show that RaiZ is a base-pairing sRNA that represses in trans the mRNA of histone-like protein HU-$\alpha$. RaiZ forms an RNA duplex with the ribosome-binding site of hupA mRNA, facilitated by ProQ, to prevent 30S ribosome loading and protein synthesis of HU-$\alpha$. Similarities and differences between ProQ- and Hfq-mediated regulation will be discussed.},

@article{Nitzan2017,
abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) are central regulators of gene expression in bacteria, controlling target genes posttranscriptionally by base pairing with their mRNAs. sRNAs are involved in many cellular processes and have unique regulatory characteristics. In this review, we discuss the properties of regulation by sRNAs and how it differs from and combines with transcriptional regulation. We describe the global characteristics of the sRNA–target networks in bacteria using graph-theoretic approaches and review the local integration of sRNAs in mixed regulatory circuits, including feed-forward loops and their combinations, feedback loops, and circuits made of an sRNA and another regulator, both derived from the same transcript. Finally, we discuss the competition effects in posttranscriptional regulatory networks that may arise over shared targets, shared regulators, and shared resources and how they may lead to signal propagation across the network.},

A web-based system is available to query, view and submit records. BIND continues to grow with the addition of individual submissions as well as interaction data from the PDB and a number of large-scale interaction and complex mapping experiments using yeast two hybrid, mass spectrometry, genetic interactions and phage display. We have developed a new graphical analysis tool that provides users with a view of the domain composition of proteins in interaction and complex records to help relate functional domains to protein interactions. An interaction network clustering tool has also been developed to help focus on regions of interest. Continued input from users has helped further mature the BIND data specification, which now includes the ability to store detailed information about genetic interactions. The BIND data specification is available as ASN.1 and XML DTD.},

	abstract = {De novo prediction of Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS) using computational methods is a difficult task and it is an important problem in Bioinformatics. The correct recognition of TFBS plays an important role in understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation and helps to develop new drugs. We here present Memetic Framework for Motif Discovery (MFMD), an algorithm that uses semi-greedy constructive heuristics as a local optimizer. In addition, we used a hybridization of the classic genetic algorithm as a global optimizer to refine the solutions initially found. MFMD can find and classify overrepresented patterns in DNA sequences and predict their respective initial positions. MFMD performance was assessed using ChIP-seq data retrieved from the JASPAR site, promoter sequences extracted from the ABS site, and artificially generated synthetic data. The MFMD was evaluated and compared with well-known approaches in the literature, called MEME and Gibbs Motif Sampler, achieving a higher f-score in the most datasets used in this work. We have developed an approach for detecting motifs in biopolymers sequences. MFMD is a freely available software that can be promising as an alternative to the development of new tools for de novo motif discovery. Its open-source software can be downloaded at
